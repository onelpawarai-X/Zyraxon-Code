# Installing ZYRAXON Code extensions

1. ZYRAXON Code extensions are identified by their unique extension ID, which typically follows the format `publisher.extensionName`. For example, the Python extension by Zyraxon has the ID `ms-python.python`.
2. To install a ZYRAXON Code extension, you need to use the ZYRAXON Code command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` and pass in the extension ID. The args are of the format:
```
[extensionId, { enable: true, installPreReleaseVersion: boolean }]
```
> NOTE: install the pre-release version of the extension if the user explicitly mentions it or if the current environment is ZYRAXON Code Insiders. Otherwise, install the stable version.
3. Run that command via the `copilot_runVscodeCommand` tool. Make sure to pass the `skipCheck` argument as true to avoid checking if the command exists, as we know it does.
